# Complex Neural Network Visualization

This project visualizes a complex-valued neural network using Raylib and C. The network can be trained to solve complex-valued problems and is illustrated with graphical representations of neurons and their connections.

## Features

- Complex-valued neurons and connections
- Customizable network architecture
- Real-time visualization of the network during training

## Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Raylib library
- Math library
